When I load the page(https://test.streamroot.io/candidates/test.html), there is no feedback on the DNA, 
everything is being passed into the CDN.

No sources are found in the Steamroot graphs no matter how many windows with the flowplayer and are playing

This error is reproducing on Safari and Chrome on MacOSX

I believe the error is rooted in the script tag in the HTML body as the source of the video is listed in there not 
allowing for the DNA to be able to locate it and create P2P using.
